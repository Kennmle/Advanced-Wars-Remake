		<h1>Home Page</h1>
		<p>This is the page we are using to quickly traverse all the data we need, as well as any extra information
		<br>
		I know the colors are ugly AF rn. Feel free to make more color schemes/change the current 2/make suggestions</p>
		<h3>Friendly Reminders</h3>
		<p> Be sure to sync Git whenever you are pushing and pulling. Also the Unity project should now be pointing to the folder "Advance-Wars-Remake" folder inside the repo folder(you will have to do this yourself)

		<h1>Movement System</h1>
		<p>
			This page is primarily meant to catch you up on what I've been doing.
			As of right now, the movement has 2 steps. When you first click on a unit,
			it's available options are highlighted in blue. This is done using a recursive
			function, adding adjacent tiles until the cost of the series of tiles is equal
			to the unit's moves.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the possible moves are displayed, a green path is created as you moves
			your mouse around. This is fairly simple; we first start off the path with
			the tile the unit is on. (From here, we only care if the selected tile is one of
			the possible moves) If the newly selected tile is inside the path,
			make the path a subpath (from the initial tile to the selected tile).
			If the selected tile is adjacent to the most recently added tile, just
			add it to the path. If the newly selected tile doesn't meet either of these
			criteria, things get a bit more complicated.
		</p>
		<p>
			If neither of these criteria are met (or if adding a new tile makes the cost too high),
			then we try to find the shortest path to the selected tile, while retaining the current
			path as best as we can. We iterate through each tile in our constructed path, from most recent to least.
			For each of these tiles, we find the shortest path between it and the selected tile. If the
			path found has too high of a cost, we try again with the preceding tile. Since the target (selected)
			tile is one of our possible moves, there exists a path from our starting tile (the one
			the unit is currently on) with a low enough cost.
		</p>
		<p>
			By the way, I used a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path algorithm.
			If you have anything that is faster, that'd be great (although I haven't experienced any issues with runtime so far).

		<h1>Battle System</h1>
		<p>This contains information pulled from the guide (link is also on the home page)</p>
		<p>The general formula for damage is: <br><br>
			[RANDOM NO. (0 to 1)] X [UNIT HP] X [ATTACK STAT / TARGET DEFENSE STAT]<br><br>
			Aside from the tables (on the guide), there are a few important details to note for whomever is implementing the battle system:
			<ul>
				<li>Only 5 units have a both a primary and secondary fire: Mech, all three Tanks, and B-Copter</li>
				<li>We might have to make two fields for weapon types (for primary and secondary), and let "none" be an option</li>
				<li>The guide also has a section on how defense is calculated with discrete values</li>
			</ul>
