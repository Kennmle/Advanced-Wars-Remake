1. INTRODUCTION
===============

Hello, and welcome to my first FAQ on an Advance Wars game! Simply put, the
Advance Wars series is easily one of the most underadvertised games Nintendo
make, and also one of the best! If you've never played Advance Wars before (why
are you looking at this then?), it is probably best that you go out and find a
copy of the original game and get hooked up (AW:DC, while it is absolutely
BRILLIANT, it's also extremely difficult, almost on par with AW2). I aim to
lend the uninitiated a helping hand with the game by listing details on the 26
units of the game.

Personally, this game is right up there as one of THE best games in the world.
The previous incarnations were also brilliant, but AW2 was frustratingly
difficult, and AW:DS was, in a word, unbalanced. Even an absolute idiot could
win thanks to some COs who were beyond broken, and to some units which were
almost unstoppable. Now, AW:DC is perfectly balanced, there are no overpowerful
COs (well, one), and every unit can be countered, resulting in a strategic
masterpiece with potentially limitless replay value (thanks to an awesome map
editor).

Differences Between AW:DC and AW:DOR
------------------------------------
* A lot of identities are different, such as the army titles, CO names, CO
  Power names, and some terrain tiles.
* Several units have different identities, and the descriptive text is also
  different. In my opinion, AW:DOR have worser unit names (exclude Mech and
  Artillery, maybe Seaplane).
* While the storyline is the same, the language used in AW:DC is much more
  serious (and better) than in AW:DOR. AW:DOR also has a liberal spread of
  profanities in the script.
* The title icon has a different look between games (not just the name change,
  obviously).
* There are also rumors of random game glitches in AW:DOR not present in AW:DC.
  I don't remember the exact details, but it involved submerged subs, bridges,
  and infantry.
* The personalities of some of AW:DOR's COs are much more extreme than in AW:DC
  (to the point where Lili and Penny act completely differently).

SERVICE HISTORY
---------------
v0.1  18/Apr/2008 - Began work on the FAQ.
v1.0  06/May/2008 - Eventually remembered to finish the FAQ and get enough data
                    in for a worthwhile posting on gameFAQs.
v1.1  18/May/2008 - Massive influx of new (and maybe useful) data.
      20/May/2008 - Allowed SuperCheats.Com permission to host the FAQ.
v1.2  21/May/2008 - Allowed MyCheats.Com and NeoSeeker.Com permission to host
                    the FAQ. Refined damage charts and included 'Attacks Used'
                    charts for units, and added additional info in various
                    sections.
      22/May/2008 - Discovered and corrected minor errors.
v1.3  23/May/2008 - Created the 'General Strategies' section (I know, it's
                    getting a bit beyond a simple unit guide).
      30/May/2008 - Allowed gamesradar.com permission to host the FAQ. Possible
                    typo fixes included.
v1.31 31/May/2008 - Corrected an error in the damage chart, and included a
                    separate 'Secondary Attack Chart' section.
v1.32 01/Jun/2008 - Corrected another damage chart error. Added a few random
                    details here and there.

Speaking of which, gameFAQs is the sole site allowed to host this FAQ. Anybody
caught posting this FAQ elsewhere will be mercilessly hunted down by a killer
lawsuit. Or something like that. I mean, I wrote this FAQ to be read by all,
just ask before nicking it for your own sites.

EDIT - Other sites have started calling for permission. I shall now list the
sites which have permission to host the FAQ

# gameFAQs.com
# supercheats.com
# mycheats.com
# neoseeker.com
# gamesradar.com

Whatever you do, don't claim this FAQ as your own work. It makes no sense at
all. It is the work of pretty much every Advance Wars forum on the internet.
Without those guys, this guide would have been left in limbo for a long time.

2. GAME MECHANICS
=================

A) DAMAGE FORMULA
-----------------
If you want to win, you need to understand how the damage system in this game
works. If you have arrived here straight from AWDS, listen up; the formula has
changed slightly. The formula is:-

[BASE DAMAGE] X [ATTACKER HP / 10] X [ATTACK STAT / TARGET DEFENSE STAT]
In the case of an attack which ends in decimal figures, the final damage is
ROUNDED DOWN.

Example: A Tank hits an enemy Tank on a road. The formula would become:-

55% X 10/10 X 100/100 = 55% Damage.

That was kind of obvious; there was no defensive cover, and the attack power of
the Tank was basic. Now assume the enemy Tank is on a Woods tile, and it has an
Ace/Veteran level. The attacker has 8HP and is at Level 1. The formula changes
to:-

55% X 08/10 X 105/(100+20+30) = 30.8%, rounds down to 30%.
Quite significant.

Also, units can deal additional damage known as 'luck'. Luck is calculated as a
random value between 0 and 1, and is multiplied by the unit HP to give up to an
additional 10% damage. Of course this means that weaker units cannot
unexpectedly deal another 1HP of damage, and weaker units will generally deal
less luck damage than healthy units.

Luck damage is also weakened by the Attack/Defense ratio mentioned earlier
(during Finn's CO Power Bad Company, it gets to the point where luck damage is
basically negligable). I am unsure of the exact formula, but my guess is:-

[RANDOM NO. (0 to 1)] X [UNIT HP] X [ATTACK STAT / TARGET DEFENSE STAT]

Here is how the Attack stat is determined:-

# The default value for attack is 100%.
# If the unit is at Level 1, add another 5%.
# If the unit is at Level 2, add another 10%.
# If the unit is at Level Ace/Vet, add another 20%
# If the unit is in the Command (CO) Zone, add another 10%.
# If the unit is in the CO Zone and meets the COs criteria, add another 10% for
  each star.
# If the team has any Communications Towers in their possession, add another 5%
  for each one.
# If there is a Sandstorm in effect (and the CO is not Lili), subtract 30%.

For your convenience, here is a list of base damage values for each unit type
combination, including those damn Meteor fragments. These are for the IDEAL
circumstances: the enemy has 100% defense (no cover) and the attack stat is
also 100%, and the Primary Weapon has ammo. Cases where primary ammo runs out
are mentioned shortly.

In some rare cases, you can continue to attack the enemy using Secondary
Weapons when you run out of ammo. It is extremely inadvisable to run around the
battlefield with no ammo, but as a last resort they can sometimes do okay
levels of damage (but only against unarmoured ground units).

There are five units that can attack even when out of ammo: the Bazooka, all
three Tank types, and the Battle Heli.

Bazooka
-------
Bazooka and Motorbike units share the same Machine Gun type, so the damage is
the same for both.

B) DEFENSE FORMULA
------------------
Defense works dramatically different from previous games. Earlier, defense was
known as 'Absolute', meaning that 20% defensive cover reduced damage by exactly
20%. With enough defense (I'm looking at Javier here) units could become
completely invulnerable. Now, defense works as an Attack/Defense RATIO. It'll
make sense in a minute.

# The default value for defense is 100%.
# If the unit has Ace/Veteran status, add another 20%.
# If the unit is in the CO Zone, add another 10%.
# If the unit is in the CO Zone and fills the COs criteria, add another 10% for
  each star.
# If the team has any Communications Towers in their possession, add another 5%
  for each one.
# If the unit is lying on defensive cover, add another 1% for each star,
  multiplied by the units HP.
# If Finn's CO Power (Bad Company) is in effect, add another 250% (I worked
  this out on my own, however I don't know if anybody else found out this
  exact value first, mail me on this one).

C) MOVEMENT COSTS TABLE
-----------------------
I should mention now that the two tables here aren't entirely my work. The
information was found on several AW forums and gameFAQs, and the table design
is adapted from a chart by 'Deathborn 668'. The chart indicates how many
mobility points are used up in crossing each type of terrain. Higher movement
costs cause the actual mobility of the unit to falter.

D) GENERAL STRATEGIES
---------------------

01) Early Game
--------------
In the first stages of pretty much any good map, you'll be looking to capture
properties to secure those all-important funds. Look around and find 'key'
properties such as production bases, com towers, and mass clumps of cities. You
should rush the capture of key distance properties rather than slowly expand
your collection from your main area onwards.

The various Infantry units have unique movement speeds and types, so they can
reach properties in varying amounts of time. Basic Infantry have 3 mobility and
are slowed down by mountains and rivers. They are also the cheapest of the
three types, and are advised for capturing where the path is full of forests or
wasteland. Bazooka/Mech units have 2 mobility and aren't slowed down at all
(although at 2 mobility it's horribly slow). Use them for capturing through
mountain ranges. Motorbikes have 5 mobility and are generally your best bet for
long-range capturing, but they are massively slowed down by any non-paved/plain
tile, and cannot cross mountains at all. They also cannot use Transporters
(excluding Landers).

For the less capable Infantry and Bazooka units, there are transport vehicles
that you can utilise to massively boost their mobility. These are the Mobile
Workshop, Transport Helicopter, Lander, and Missile Boat. They can drop off
your Infantry in relative safety and, providing it can return to base, it can
be re-used to transport more units around. However, they cost at least two
Bazooka/Motorbike units to build, so they should be used carefully.

Mobile Workshops can haul Infantry around ground maps with 6 mobility, resupply
more rounds to Bazooka units, and build Temporary Structures (more on those
later). In essence, these pretty much act as little 'bases' for your Bazooka
units. However while they can easily outrun Motorbikes across heavy terrain,
light unrestrictive land means that it can prove tricky for this unit to pay
for itself in comparison to a Motorbike. On the plus side, it's fairly sturdy
in the early game, and the onboard Infantry won't be harmed at all if it comes
under fire(unless the unit is destroyed, in which case both units are lost).

Transport Helicopters are usually your best bet for moving foot soldiers about.
They travel by air, so they aren't slowed down at all, and they are fairly
quick to boot. They burn fuel daily, so the return leg can be a little close
for call on a few occasions. The main problem is that they are notoriously
incapable of withstanding attacks, and they are preyed upon by a lot of stuff.

Landing craft can transport 2 units of any type (from Infantry to Motorbike to
Mega Tank) across naval maps. They are pretty damn strong and fairly quick.
Only capable of dropping off units on Shoals and ports, it's range of areas it
can be used for is sometimes a little off. It also burns fuel daily.

Missile Boats are a new addition (and replaces the AW:DS Black Boat) and are a
good thing to have around with you. They have the highest movement range of any
transporter (7 mobility outruns a lot of stuff including every other naval
unit) and act like Landers. They can transport ONE foot soldier (so it's like
the Workshop) and drop off at beaches and the like. They are also capable of
self-defense: they have a powerful anti-ship weapon that usually pays for the
cost of the unit if it connects. After it strikes, it becomes defenseless,
having only one shot. It's also extremely fragile and it doesn't take much
effort to sink one.

Once you've become skilled in perfecting your early game abilities, why not try
screwing up your opponent's opening turns while you're at it? Usually you're
best sticking to using Recons to disrupt the enemy as they are cheap, really
fast (well, most of the time) and do enough damage to warrant some severe
cursing from your opponent. Sometimes you can send other types around to cause
annoyances. Using Flare tanks is a good idea on plains-heavy maps where Recons
would get hit quite badly by the terrain penalty (as well as intercepting enemy
Recons aiming to cause you some trouble as well). Battle Heli's and the
Fighter/Duster are useful in long-range naval maps. However, doing this will
usually just cause your opponent to divert his funds to developing a simple
countermeasure (this is sometimes a good thing though). Rememer not to spend
too much on early disrupture of the enemy, and focus on building a powerful
assault force.

If the enemy is causing you some hassle, develop counters of your own. A good
way of trying to annoy enemy Recons is to prioritise building Bazooka units and
Mobile Workshops to move them fast. Recons excel when they attack Infantry and
Motorbikes because the counterattack damage only becomes apparent after a few
attacks. Bazooka units can quickly nullify the threat of a Recon, and even if
the Recon gets a first strike, the counter is much more noticeable.



02) Direct Fire Units
---------------------
Direct units attack enemies by moving next to them to launch an attack. Direct
attacks are simple and usually effective, but there are a few drawbacks, most
notably luring. Be aware that most opponents are sneaky bastards and love to
taunt your most important units into the range of their indirects and other
powerhouses. Only wander into the range of indirects if you have enough units
at hand to completely annahilate the enemy's stranglehold on the area, or you
quite frankly have no choice in the matter.

Direct attackers will suffer counterattack damage (unless the opponent can't
hit the target, or the opponent is wiped out). Even the most resiliant units
can have their HP slowly whittled away by luck damage. The best way to null
the threat of counterattack damage in direct attacks is to maximise your attack
power by unit promotion and CO Zone, or simply using heavy armour. Counter
damage is basically negligable if you leave enemies at 2HP at most.

Most of the time, direct units will be playing what is known as 'range dodging'
with enemy units. On several occasions, tanks may face enemy tanks and stay at
the edge of each other's attack range. This is rangedodging, and one reason why
people keep shunning the Mega Tank. More agile units (Missile Boats and Light
Tanks) can sit outside the range of other units and attack the next turn, often
forcing the enemy to retreat. Don't let this happen to you. If it does, have
spare units or heavy armour around to deter the threat.

Fog of War has changed massively in the transition from the previous game.
There are loads more hiding places for enemy units to hide around. Compared to
before, unit vision is spread across the entire area that they move (instead of
just being moved about, causing visible enemies to vanish from view), and so
hiding places are much less effective. Have your directs drive past many hiding
places in one turn to scan them all at once for the enemy, then whack'em!



03) Indirect Fire Units
-----------------------
Indirect units bombard the enemy from far away with no fear of suffering a
counterattack. Indirects cannot move and fire on the same turn (excuding the
Battleship), cannot counterattack when hit (excluding the Anti-Tank) and have a
'blind-spot' where it cannot strike (excuding both the above units).

Indirects are fundamental in success in almost any map, but are at their most
effective in choke-points (mentioned later). Indirects are also great for
laying a defensive 'shroud of fire' around allied units: your units become much
less attractive a target if enemies will get pounded by your Rockets!

Protecting indirects is extremely important. Because they cannot counterattack
(and because some are really costly), they will always be considered a priority
target by your foe. They are also really fragile, so defending them becomes an
art that must be mastered. Loads of people suggest the use of Infantry units as
blocking units, but they cannot take much damage and are extremely easy to KO
in one hit at that stage of the battle. Also, a good player can move his CO
Zone so the shielding units charge his CO Meter like there was no tomorrow. The
art of defending units with other units is commonly known as 'meatshielding'
and it doesn't apply solely to indirects, either.

Fog of War was almost a godsend for Indirects. Previously, all indirects were
blind and needed Recons to spot stuff to shoot at. Now, the improved Mech
Gun/Artillery unit has enough vision to act independantly from other units.
Indirects use hiding places to thrive and survive, relentlessly pounding away
at the enemy while they are stuck thinking "where the hell did that come from?"
and such. If the area you wish to use has no hiding place, make one! Have a
Mobile Workshop build a Temporary structure to hide your cowardly indirects.
The enemy may now know where they are, but they can't hit it if they can't see
it!



04) COs And CO Powers
---------------------
There are twelve Commanding Officers (COs) in this game and they all play quite
differently. There is also a 13th option: playing with no CO at all. I advise
inexperienced players to fight a few Free Battles in No CO mode. The boost from
the CO Zone may be handy, but in most cases there are multiple battles all over
the place and you can only fight the rest using a 'bland' army. Get used to
getting units at Ace/Veteran Level: these are extremely important for No CO
mode. Units level-up when they KILL a unit (whichever unit lands the last hit
gets the level, even if they did minimal damage).

To use the abilities of the CO, he/she must first board the unit, either at the
HQ or a production base (temp. structures don't count). When the unit is on one
select the CO option from the move menu (don't move the unit from the base) to
board the unit at 50% the cost of the unit it has boarded. CO Units are at the
maximum level (Ace/Vet) by default, and they also generate a CO Zone around
them. The radius and effects of the Zone vary across COs.

Ten of the COs also have a CO Power they can use to tear the rulebook to shreds
and potentially turn the entire game around. Battles that take place in the CO
Zone increase the CO Meter. The meter has two distinct halves, each with 6
individual segments. Each segment fills up with every 5HP damage you cause,
irrespective of what unit it was. Counterattack damage by your units also fuel
the CO Meter, but the enemy must also be in the CO Zone for this to occur.

When the first half of the CO Meter is filled, the radius of the CO Zone goes
up by one. When filled totally, the radius increases by another one, and the CO
unit can choose to exchange its entire meter (and its turn) for usage of the CO
Power. Upon usage of the CO Power, the meter drops to Zero, and the Zone fills
the entire battlefield (so every unit gets boosted, not just those in the zone)
however the meter cannot recharge during a CO Power. In addition to boosting
all units, an additional effect occurs that helps the player. These vary from
CO to CO, and some are more useful than others.

If the CO Unit is destroyed, the meter falls to zero, the Zone dissappears, and
the user will have to wait until his next turn to re-deploy the CO. If the CO
Power was in effect, the effects of the CO Power will also be nulled.

When it comes to the actual COs, you'll want to adapt your strategies to make
the most of the abilities of the CO. The Zone gives a bland boost by default
(10% increase in attack and defense) and other boosts depending on the CO.
Stat boosts are mentioned as (Atk/Def %):-

*SPOILER WARNING*

Ed/Will
Laurentian military cadet rescued by the 12th Independant Legion, led by
Captain O'Brian. He vigilantly refuses to give up, at any cost. He also
shares a close friendship with the amnesiac Catleia.
CO Zone Radius: 2, boosts Ground Directs by 20%/00%.
CO Power: New Era/Rally Cry. Increases mobility of Ground Directs by 2.

Moderately useful. Although he is a specialist CO, the units he boosts are
extremely important. During New Era, his directs gain enough mobility to
allow him to tear dispersed enemy armies apart. His effectiveness weakens
on choke-point laden and island maps.



O'Brian/Brenner
Captain of the 12th Independant Legion (Brenner's Wolves in AW:DOR), he has
massive faith in the power of humanity. It remains strong despite the actions
of people such as Admiral Sigismundo and the bloody Mayor of Freehaven. He is
killed (or rather annahilated) by Sigismundo via one of Stolos' creations.
CO Zone Radius: 3, boosts all units by 00%/20%
CO Power: Lifeline/Reinforce. Restores 3HP to all units for free.

Easily my favourite CO of them all. O'Brian is far from an aggressive CO to
play as, so you will need to use a slow and steady approach. Defense boosts
mean blocking units withstand more damage, so its best to use indirects as him.
Lifeline patches up unit damage without cost (akin to Andy from earlier games),
so build more expensive units to exploit the free repairs to the max.



Lin
Second in command of the 12th Independant Legion. Calm and 'unflappable', she
believes that "In battle, the clearest thinker wins".
CO Zone Radius: 1, boosts Ground Units by 20%/20%.
CO Power: Night Vision/Scout. Increases vision by 2, hiding places become
visible from any range.

Another specialist CO, Lin is hard to use due to her weak CO radius. Don't fret
though, as the boost affects all ground units, and they are the most important.
You may want to treat Lin's unit as a solo powerhouse: go beserk and hit lots
of stuff, then return with (hopefully) a larger CO Zone. Her CO Power is quite
weak, but the boosts are strong and can prove decisive. Mostly though, you will
want to hang on to the increased Zone.



Catleia/Isabella
An amnesiac girl who remebers nothing, except for pretty much every single
military secret on the planet. She develops a strong friendship with Ed, and is
probably the one person who's wishes Ed fights for: peace. You don't play as
her in the main story mode for unknown reasons.
CO Zone Radius: 2, boosts All Units by 10%/10%.
CO Power: Overlord/Deep Strike. Increases indirect attack range by 2, and all
mobility by 2.

The boosts may only be minor, but Catleia is definitely a top-tier CO, if only
for the awesome CO Power. Overlord grants battlefield opportunites that some
COs in AW:DS would have died for. Use enhanced range to pummel forces from afar,
have directs move at lightning speed for vital kills. And of course, having
14 RANGE BATTLESHIPS. Has an unusually peaceful soundtrack too.



Zadia/Tasha
Flight Lieutenant of the Zephyrian/Lazurian army. She fights solely to avenge
the death of his brother Johnathon, who was executed by Sigismundo and the New
Laurentian/Rubinelle Army. Later on she would join the 12th Independant Legion
to fight the NLA.
CO Zone Radius: 1, boosts Aerial units by 40%/20%.
CO Power: Fox One/Sonic Boom. Increases Aerial unit mobility by 2.

Zadia is extremely difficult to use, however the pay-off can be lethal. Like
Lin, you can try to exploit the CO unit and mercilessly blow up stuff (which
with a 170% Attck stat isn't very hard). But Air units seem to play a weaker
role in battle with cheap, improved countermeasures. You may actually want to
put her in a Tank and take the fight to the ground. Then have the air force
ready to unleash Fox One. 11-range Interceptors and 9-range Bombers simply
annahilating everything in their path: priceless.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 12: History Of Hatred/History Of Hate.



Trak/Gage
Zephyrian army soldier, with ice blue hair and sniper rifle for the win. He
brings back memories of Hawke with his quiet and serious persona. He does what
is necessary, and that is enough to keep him happy.
CO Zone Radius: 2, Increases naval units and indirects by 20%/10%.
CO Power: Long Barrel/Longshot. Increases indirect range by 2.

Pretty basic CO, but gains plus points for coolness. Although his indirects
have increased power, range is only boosted during Long Barrel, so don't think
of him as the new Grit. His major boon, aside from the CO Power, is his naval
game. Trak in a Battleship; great fun. His directs are a little un-boosted, so
watch for people forcing a change in your tactics.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 13: Rearguard Action/Greyfield Strikes.



Carter/Forsythe
Current leader of the Zephyrian Army. A veteran with honour and morals, Carter
is comparable to O'Brian. He sticks by his code of honour and dismisses the use
of war-breaking devices made by Stolos. He is eventually executed at the hands
of Sigismundo and Finn.
CO Zone Radius: 5! Increases all units by 10%/10%.
CO Power: He doesn't have one. That means the radius doesn't get any bigger.

Carter is simple to use and extremely effective. A massive CO Zone is offset by
the lack of a CO Power to turn the tables. Minor boosts to a lot of units means
that Carter can strike hard using lots of units, rather than a single power-hit
with Lin or Zadia. Easily a high-tier CO.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 14: A Hero's Farewell.



Finn/Waylon
Captain in the 13th Airborne division of the Laurentan Army, later transferred
to the New Laurentian Army. As Finn, he is vain and seeks only to fulfill his
desires. As his US persona Waylon, he also gets some of the more memorable
quotes in the game. His whereabouts at the end of the game are unknown...
CO Zone Radius: 2, boosts aerial units by 20%/30%.
CO Power: Bad Company/Wingman. Increases aerial defense by 250%.

A more user-friendly variation of the aerial specialist. His defensive boost is
severe enough to deter attempts to attack his CO unit using like units. Unlike
Zadia, Finn is best in the air blowing stuff up. Use Bad Company to basically
reduce damage by +75% and blast into enemy territory with less fear. Be aware
that you can only attack for that turn. Afterwards, you are vulnerable to
attack.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 20: Counter-Attack/Waylon Flies Again.



Sigismundo/Greyfield
Admiral and supreme leader of the New Laurentian Army. He wants to destroy
anyone who stands in the path of his route to becoming ruler of the Earth. He
sees the meteor strike as a mere 'test' for the strong, and is seen by a few
fans as the most evil character in the game. He is eventually executed by Lin,
avenging the death of O'Brian (although with his bodily bulk, I'm surprised Lin
didn't use a harpoon to bring down the fat walrus).
CO Zone Radius: 3, boosts Heli's, Ship Planes and naval units by 10%/40%.
CO Power: High Command/Supply Chain. restores fuel ammo AND materials.

He's awkward to use, but Sigismundo has an ace on every battlefield. On ground
battles, he can have powerhouse units keep moving by restoring ammo at crucial
times. In Aerial battles, his Battle Heli's are incredibly stubborn to erase.
He truly shines in naval battles, though. His navy is almost untouchable, so
prioritising his CO Unit in a naval battle is even more important. Human
players tend to leave behind loads of temporary structures on the field with
Mobile Workshops getting their materials back.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 21: Countdown/Lin's Gambit.



Lili/Penny
Youngest child of Stolos, Lili is quite mental. Numerous experiments have
shattered her mind permanently. She is more memorable in AW:DOR where she
seems to be a collaborative mind of her and her teddy bear. She survives the
storyline after being 'rescued' from the IDS Pulsatrix/Great Owl mega-bomber by
Catleia.
CO Zone Radius: 3, no boosts though. All units are unaffected by weather.
CO Power: Enigma/Stormfront. Randomly changes weather conditions for 3 days.

Lili revolves solely around her CO Power. Without it, she is outgunned even by
Zadia. The weather changes to either Snow, Rain or Sandstorm for three turns
incuding the turn it is triggered. Snow reduces mobility by 1, allowing Lili to
range-dodge more effectively. Rain reduces enemy vision to 1 and blinds base
vision (even Lili's bases). Sandstorm forces the enemy to lose 30% attack power
and is extremely useful. With the duration of the weather, Lili can even chain
CO Powers back-to-back, making her almost unstoppable in the right hands. Also
has the most unusual theme tune in almost any game.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 24: Inside Pulsatrix/Crash Landing.



Larissa/Tabitha
Oldest daughter of Stolos, Larissa has, quite easily, the most unusual dress
code for almost any computer game character. Supposedly cruel and harbors a
hatred of weak people (especially as Tabitha in AW:DOR, where she is also quite
rude), she loyally follows her fathers footsteps. She hosts some of the best
Tactics talks in story mode, where she tries to get Ed to be her servant for
life. She is still alive at the end of the story, but her whereabouts are
unknown...
CO Zone Radius: ZERO. Boosts all units by 50%/50%.
CO Power: Apocalypse/Firestorm. Launches a fireball at the most expensive area
of enemy units. Damages units for 8HP.

Loads of forums out there have topics debating whether this CO is actually in
the Broken tier, alongside her father Stolos. All I can say to the contrary is
that her usefulness reflects the capability of the player controllong her. It
is extremely difficult to use Larissa considering her Zone only affects her
unit from the off. But the boosts are incredible, and bends the rulebook in her
favour on most occasions. When facing her, HER UNIT IS THE PRIORITY. If she
gets her meter to 50% full, she will gain momentum very fast and launch her
CO Power, basically winning the battle for her. Her main weakness is that until
then, the rest of her army is bland. So prioritise her unit while using your
own CO Zone to nullify her supporting army.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 25: Final Experiment/Lab Rats.



Stolos/Caulder
Head of the private military company Intelligent Defense Systems, IDS. He has
a unique fascination with death, and has conducted many inhumane experiments in
his life. He is actually the only remaining clone of the original Stolos: he
cloned himself many times, but the clones started fighting each other. What we
see here is the sole survivor. He also created the dreaded Floral Virus/Creeper
and he also cloned Larissa, Lili, Catleia (known as Lutia) and a younger
pacifist brother named Cyrus. He is killed in the wreckage of the Owl's Nest,
his main base of operations.
CO Zone Radius: 3. Boosts all units by 50%/50%, and heals for 5HP each turn.
CO Power: He doesn't need one. He's powerful enough with those boosts.

THE Broken CO in the game, Stolos outguns everybody. If you face him, you will
almost certainly get mowed down. I don't need to say much about Stolos: he is
banned from Wi-Fi play, and players mutually agree not to play as him.

Unlocked by defeating Mission 26: Beam Of Light/Sunrise.

*END SPOILER WARNING*



05) Choke Point Central
-----------------------
To new players, look at some maps and find areas where the land forces the path
of enemy units into a very narrow passage. This is known as a chokepoint, and
it is critical to success. By simply parking a unit in the choke, you have made
a wall against the enemy onslaught.

Chokes are often blocked by expendable Infantry, but they will simply fuel a
good player's CO Meter in my experience. You will want to block the choke using
heavy armour (you CAN get away with a Tank, but heavier armour is advised) to
make it hard for the enemy to press on. They may be expensive, but they are
much more useful and stubborn to wipe out, especially on harsh terrain. Try to
place the blocker unit on defensive cover (especially Woods, even moreso in Fog
of War) to further boost the defense. Be aware that this defense will go down
if the unit has sustained ANY damage.

The reason why people keep saying how chokepoints can turn the battle around is
because indirect units thrive on chokes. Guard the area in front of the blocker
unit with a simple Mech Gun, and you can force the enemy to back off, giving
you some breathing space.

Countering an enemy's stranglehold on a choke can be tricky, and downright evil
on ground-only maps. You will want to knock down the enemy blocker unit, but
you need indirects of your own to do this (or face getting smashed by the enemy
indirect). The best unit to use is the Rocket unit. Providing they don't have
one, simply out-ranging the enemy can give you the edge (and a well-deserved
punch in the face in non-Wi-Fi matches). In Ground-Aerial battles, chokes
are MUCH less effective as Battle Heli's and Bombers can navigate around the
blocking units to get a power-hit on the indirects.



06) How To Beat Various Map Types
---------------------------------
Loads of different maps lie in this game (and on the Internet), and some types
require unique approaches.

Ground-only battles are simple, all-out affairs. Be extremely wary of chokes,
as it can be almost impossible to beat one without a CO Power. In wide spaces,
COs such as Ed and Catleia with their CO Powers have a distinct advantage.

Ground-Aerial battles are great fun. Depending on how many chokes the map has,
you can have lots of dogfighting in a few turns. Chokes are much weaker here
than before, so have a good air force around: it'll prove vital to success. The
aerial specialists can have a good chance for victory here.

Ground-Naval battles can get tricky. Ground units have almost nothing to hit
the navy with, so take the fight to the seas with Battleships (with Cruiser
escort, obviously), Submarines and Carriers. Carriers allow for aerial battles
even if there are no airports; build Temporary structures at will to allow the
Ship Planes to work alongside your ground invasion. The navy specialists shine
in these fights.

Ground-Naval-Aerial battles are easily the hardest fights in the game. There
are countless possibilities for strategies and methods of countering them, so
my only advice is to understand and exploit each units advantages to the full.
CO choice is tricky, my advice is to choose who you feel most comfortable with.

Maps also are divided into two distinct types: Solo Mass levels (one island,
sometimes linked to another half by Bridges) and Island maps (many different
islands to fight over). The sole type players should NOT fight on are G-A
fights on Island maps (Triangles and Devil's Inlet). Those maps always end up
as stalemates.

Island maps are hardest of the two, since you will need lots of Landers to make
an effective landfall, and protection for them too. The best plan is to
determine what you need to send into the enemy domain, and organise your
Landers and where they will drop off your army. You will want to land as many
units as possible on ONE turn: if you drop few units, you will lose them, it's
that simple. Its also advised to lay covering fire for these units, use aerial
units and Battleships to lay a solid foothold on the ground so you can move on
with minimal resistance. If there are properties, ensure you have some Infantry
in the landing squad so you can secure extra funds, as well as a repair area
for the ground troops.

There are loads more map types out there, and I can only summarise the general
types you will find. However, there are some odd types of maps out there, and
you can generally find these on the 'Advance Wars By Web' website. A fan's
attempt at creating an online variation of AW:DS, it also harbors pretty much
THE biggest map archive on the internet. However, you'll have to copy them to
your game manually, and you may also have to adapt them to fit the new game's
tiles (ie you can't use pipelines and units exclusive to AW:DS). But once you
get good at adapting maps from here, you can essentially multiply the
replayability of the game by a limitless amount!

============
3. THE UNITS
============

I will list critical details about units, such as pricing, movement range/type,
power, as well as information about how (or if) the unit has changed from
previous games, and US names (oddly, unit and CO names from AW:DC and AW:DOR
are rather different. The language used in the storylines also vary a bit as
well).

# Armor applies to vehicles and determines its defensive capability. Armor
  varies from SL (super light) through to SH (super heavy). Offensive units
  will have their ability to take on various armor mentioned in the summary.

# Cost is funding required to deploy the unit (if the price has changed, the
  difference is stated).

# Range is the maximum movement range of the unit. Remember that terrain limits
  this in some cases.

# Vision is the vision range of the unit in Fog of War conditions. No matter
  how large this is, you can only see into hiding places when you are next to
  them. Certain units can only hide in certain places, these cases will be
  noted in the intro for each unit category.

# Type is the movement type used by the unit. It dictates what the unit
  can(not) traverse, and how quickly it can travel across it.

# Fuel is the maximum number of spaces the unit can travel before it cannot
  move any more. Remember that non-ground units burn fuel automatically each
  day. If the counter reaches 0, the unit either becomes immobile or falls out
  of the sky/sinks into the sea.

# Primary Weapon is the units main weapon (if it has one). Ammo for the weapon
  is in brackets. If the primary weapon runs out of ammo, the unit can only
  attack with the secondary weapon (if it even has one). Certain targets can
  only be hit using the Primary Weapon (usually applies to attacks against
  Naval units by Tanks).

# Attack Range applies to indirect units, and states how far the attacks of the
  unit can reach.

# Secondary Weapon is the units backup weapon, if it has one. These have
  infinite ammunition, but are less effective than primary weapons. They are
  sometimes used against specific units (usually Infantry and Helicopters).

# Material is sometimes equipped with units. These can be used to build stuff,
  but materials cannot be resupplied (excluding Sigismundo's CO Power High
  Command) so another unit is needed to gain more materials.

# Attacks Used shows which weapon(s) are used in attacks against certain units.
  Specific units can only be harmed by either Primary or Secondary weapons.
  Primary Weapons will always be used over Secondary Weapons unless there is no
  ammo for the Primary Weapon.

# Positives is a list of good things about the unit. All units have something
  going for them, exploiting these points to their maximum is one of the many
  keys to success in the game.

# Negatives is a list of bad things about the unit. Take these into account
  when choosing between different units to deploy.

# My Two Cents is my personal opinion of the unit, an in-depth description of
  how the unit can be used to their full, and sometimes mentions how the unit
  can be countered.

# Takedown is the suggested method of eliminating the unit with minimal
  trouble. This term 'Takedown' is the art of destroying enemy units in one
  attack.

# CPR is Command Post Recommendation. This lists whether the unit is useful as
  a CO Unit, and it tends to mention what units the CO Unit can now
  cripple/takedown.

# AI Posts is a list of which COs will board this unit when controlled by the
  AI. Useful this; if you see the computer build one, try to hit it for at
  least 3HP damage. If you can, you can prevent the CO from wanting to board
  it. Due to certain COs only wanting to board the more expensive units, even
  top-tier COs controlled by the AI can be easily beaten.

# E-3-2-1 is the system that I use to summarise what the unit is effective
  against and vulnerable to. For each of these four tags, there is a list of
  unit abbreviations.

E - Units that this unit is effective against. With a few exceptions,
    'efffective' attacks deal at least 4 HP of damage.
3 - Units that can take down this unit in two or three attacks. These units can
    face off against the defender and usually get 'even damage' (attacker loses
    2, enemy loses 4-5)
2 - Units that can score heavy damage on this unit. Users should watch out for
    these. When softened up slightly, there is the risk of a KO.
1 - Units that can potentially one-hit-KO the unit. Stay away at all costs!

For American readers, I will use the EU names for each CO. Beats having to
write (EU Name/US Name) all the time. The listing is as follows:-

   EU Name <-> US Name
========================
        Ed <-> Will
   O'Brian <-> Brenner
       Lin <-> Lin
   Catleia <-> Isabella
     Zadia <-> Tasha
      Trak <-> Gage
    Carter <-> Forsythe
      Finn <-> Waylon
Sigismundo <-> Greyfield
      Lili <-> Penny
   Larissa <-> Tabitha

I should also mention what the Yellow/Red Danger symbols on the units data
screen mean (I haven't listed them because the E-3-2-1 system works better in
my opinion). Units in the Yellow category deal +70% damage to the unit, and Red
category units deal +90% damage. In essence, it's a summary sheet of what units
can cause collateral damage to the target.

A) GROUND UNITS
---------------

Ground units do not burn fuel on a daily basis like the other units. If these
units run out of fuel they are stranded until they gain fuel via a CO Power or
Mobile Workshop or joining with another unit which has fuel.

Ground unit hiding places include Ruins, Woods, and any Base that does not
belong to the enemy. Even if you park on another enemys base (in 3-4 way
brawls), it is only visible to that player.

Positives

Cheapest unit (costs more than it used to, though).

Fastest soldier across difficult terrain.
Vision increases by 3 when on a mountain.
Effective against Anti-Tanks.

Negatives
---------
Pose little threat to armor.
Does negligable damage to non-infantry units (except Transport Helicopters).

My Two Cents
------------
Infantry units form the core of pretty much any army. You need these units to
capture bases to help secure funds for those more decisive units, and you need
them to launch missile silos as well.

On the battlefield, Infantry are pretty much cannon fodder. They are only good
against other Infantry units. They suffer slightly against the more advanced
Infantry (Bazooka and Motorbikes). They can be used as a cheap 'meatshield' for
your indirects as well. They also work as an effective anti-Anti-Tank unit, as
it deals the same damage to it as the more expensive Light Tank.

Takedown
--------
Loads of stuff can KO infantry, but sweeping them away in one attack can prove
tricky, especially if it is parked on heavy terrain. AAs, Mega Tanks, and
Bombers can nail the elusive OHKO, but they need to be at Level 2 before you
can try for a takedown in the more restrictive areas.

CPR
---
Not really. With the exception of a few Trial maps and super-small maps, it is
inadvisable to put your CO aboard one (unless you prioritise the CO Zone over a
CO unit).

Most powerful ground direct vs Anti-Tanks.
Cheaper than in previous games.

Negatives
---------
Slowest unit in the game.
Generally incapable of counterattacking well.

My Two Cents
------------
Mech units have remained largely unchanged. Their biggest boon is the reduced
cost from previous games, which allows for them to be spammed at will. Be aware
that while Mech Spamming is still an effective tactic, it only works well
against inexperienced players; veterans of the series can get past these with
no problems.

Offensively, Mech units are extremely good, but the 2 Mobility will ensure that
it reaches its destination by next July unless you use transporters. The low
mobility also puts it at immense risk of being hit first in an attack. It also
has massive trouble with indirects. Other than that, if the Mech attacks, the
target will be in some severe pain. It also has the distinction of being the
most effective ground direct unit against Anti-Tanks (but the range makes it
vulnerable on the approach, and experienced players will not allow you to
connect the attack).

Takedown
--------
Oh god. Taking them out is easy, taking them out in one hit can prove a
daunting task, even for the AA and the Mega Tank. Fortunately, you have an ace
in the form of Bombers and ranged attacks. These units cannot move through the
range of an indirect unless it is Fog of War. Nonetheless, it is more resiliant
to damage than the standard Infantry, and that makes takedowns difficult.
Hitting them for less than 8HP damage is inadvisable as the counterattack
damage from the Bazooka's, well, Bazooka will eventually make your powerhouse
units ineffective over a period of time.

CPR

Unless your CO is Stolos (b*****d) and you're gunning for the HQ capture, it's
not a good idea. Mainly due to being so damn slow.

Effective against Anti-Tanks.

Negatives
---------
Completely harmless against armor.
Cannot board Transporters (excluding Landers).
Agility is ruined by heavy terrain.
Cannot traverse mountains.

My Two Cents
------------
As soon as the Motorbike was announced for this game, players all over were
saying that they would never need Infantry units ever again. Now its here, it
doesn't quite live up to its hype. It has 5 mobility, so it can reach long
range properties faster and cheaper than an Infantry-APC combo. However, it has
move type Tire B, so it is terrible in woods, and cannot move across mountains.
Also take into account how quickly various Infantry type units can reach their
targets. In rare cases, Infantry can reach them just as fast as Motorbikes.

In battle, Motorbikes act as nimble Mech units minus the Bazooka. Possessing
superior defense and speed than the Infantry, these act as a more dependable
form of 'meatshield'. At Ace/Vet level, Motorbikes can act as a point defense
unit against Infantry units flying over to your HQ from a Transport Helicopter.
It is also the sworn enemy of Anti-Tanks, being capable of sitting well out of
its attack range and dealing solid damage on the offensive. All in all, a good
unit to have on your side, just remember that Infantry have their uses as well.

Takedown
--------
The same rules apply for the Motorbike as the Bazooka, but the Motorbike has it
harder because it is unlikely to lie in harsh terrain due to its move type.
Plus, the lack of a Bazooka means that it cannot score solid counterattack
damage on most occasions.

CPR
---
Okay choice for an inexpensive posting. Its mobility allows for local spreading
of the CO Zone, and you can gun down enemy Infantry without much hassle.

My Two Cents
------------
They were designed for use in Fog of War, with a vision range of 5 it could
spot incoming threats before they could see you. Now in this game, with loads
more hiding places than before, it has a rival in the form of the Flare tank.
Both have their advantages, the Recon's being beneficial in light terrain, as
well as spotting air units (after all, they can't hide at all).

On the battlefield, Recons act as cheap anti-Infantry units. If there are
plenty of roads to help this Tire A type unit across to the enemy, it also
works to disturb the enemys early-game equilibrium and slow down their rate of
capture. Other than these points, they can annoy enemy indirects, although you
shouldn't expect a KO.

Takedown
--------
If it causes an explosion, it stands a chance at taking this unit down in one
hit when at Ace/Vet level. Recons have the notorious ability to be flattened by
even Bazooka units. At Level 0, Mega Tanks and Bombers can sweep these away.

CPR
---
You can do worse, but this isn't too good an idea. If there are many roads, it
is excellent for moving the CO Zone about, but you're stuck to hitting Infantry
and enemy Indirects for the most part.

Slightly lacking in speed.

Inftry|---| Y

My Two Cents
------------
This new addition to the roster is rather interesting in practice. To fire a
Flare Rocket, don't move the Flare and you get the option to fire the flare up
to five squares away. The actual flare illuminates a 13-square area of land,
including hiding places. In levels with lots of woods, it is probably advisable
to prioritise building Flares over Recons. Flares reveal units hidden in any
hiding place, but they will not reveal submerged Submarines.

Outside of Fog of War, this unit has a few things over the slightly cheaper
Recon unit. Firstly, it runs on tracks, so if the terrain is plains-heavy, this
unit outmaneouvres the Recon. Secondly, it is 'slightly' more powerful than the
Recon against Infantry. Most importantly, however, it can tear apart enemy
Recons, as well as break even against Anti-Air units.

Takedown
--------
The major difference between the attack and defense abilities of this and the
Recon is that the Flare has more attack power. Thus, it can be stomped on in
the same manner.

CPR
---
At this price range, it would usually be wise to save up for a CO Tank, or fall
back on a CO Recon or Motorbike. It may be more useful than the Recon, but its
not too fast and is torn apart by explosive weaponry.

My Two Cents
------------
THE primary counter to an aerial assault. This unit turns choppers into Swiss
Cheese, and tears apart planes as well. The single aerial unit the AA needs to
watch for is the Bomber, which isn't afraid to flatten the AA unit. You can
discourage this by having AA units travel in pairs. The backup can make an
enemy attack extremely cost-ineffective.

Apart from this, the AA unit is extremely stubborn in a ground battle as well.
Its the single most cost-effective counter against swarms of Infantry, and it
can also hurt indirects very well. Just watch out for Tanks, though.

Takedown
--------
Although this thing will fall at the hands of Tanks, it takes a Mega Tank or
Ace/Vet Heavy Tank to knock them down in a single hit. Don't attack these with
Bazooka units unless it is the finishing attack, otherwise the counterattack
will hurt a bit.

CPR
---
Introducing the CO powered AA, the latest technology in bug extermination. Have
your CO board an AA unit, and you'll have Infantry flying about in diverse
directions, and be KO'ing Fighters in one attack, and crippling anything else
that's airborne. A fun post no doubt. You'll just have to rely on the CO Zone
to bring down those damn Tanks.

My Two Cents
------------
Always a staple unit, and easy to use. Not much to say, they are effective at
what they do; blow stuff up. They have superior mobility to their more powerful
cousins, and can therefore be used to great effect in breaking a ground
stalemate by forcing the enemy to make a move.

However, you would be hoping the Tank had even more power in some cases. It's
completely helpless against Mega Tanks and Anti-Tanks. It can do okay damage to
Heavy Tanks, but the Tank must strike first, and the target must be out in the
open for the trade-off to be worthy.

Takedown
--------
Only the Bomber and a boosted Mega Tank can get the one-shot here. Anti-Tanks
will work, but the problem with the Anti-Tank is that it's usefulness shines
only at chokepoints. Their move-or-shoot behaviour makes it ineffective in open
terrain as they will just back off and attack your other units. Choppers work
too.

CPR
---
Most people say that there are only two decent CO Posts, the Light Tank, and
the Fighter/Duster. For the most part, they are correct: A CO Tank can
generally score takedowns on unarmoured ground units. It's pretty fast, and
solid all-around, and can take on bland Heavy Tanks. No faults here.

My Two Cents
------------
In comparision to its previous forms in older AW games, the Heavy Tank is a
shadow of its former glory, especially in terms of defense. Not to worry,
though. The price went down, and that makes this unit better than ever. Its
mobility is slightly weaker than the Light Tank, but this will only cause major
annoyances in heavy terrain. With the lower cost, its even possible to spam the
Heavy Tank.

It has enough attack power to make most ground units cringe, and turn Recons
into scrap in one attack. At Ace/Vet level, it becomes the best of the ground
units. Be aware that until then, don't get hit by indirects and Anti-Tanks, and
get the first strike on any enemy Mega-Tanks.

Takedown
--------
Bombers can flatten them in a single bound. Other than this, you'll need some
heavy armour of your own to nullify the threat of these tracked menaces. As
before, you can use Anti-Tanks against them, but only in those damn
chokepoints. You can also try just throwing everything you have at it.
Eventually the Heavy Tank will fall, or limp away with little health left.
Battle Heli's can also cause them some annoyances, but it'll be a bit of a
struggle, and a good player will always have an AA on standby.

CPR
---
For 18000, a CO Heavy Tank is rather costly, but also ridiculously effective
at tearing things to shreds, including Light Tanks. If you are looking for a
powerhouse, this is probably your best bet.

My Two Cents
------------
This unit is nothing like you would expect. The large attack power is always
handy, but the armor is rather weak for something that looks like a solid block
of steel. Most often used as a CO command post by AI players when they aren't
busy in Fighters. Irrespective of these points, the Mega Tank is excellent at
holding key properties, and is nowhere near as terrible as people keep saying
about it.

The biggest criticism of the Mega-Tank is the paltry movement range. However,
on small maps this isn't a problem at all, and on larger maps, you would
usually have factories close to the front lines anyways. The main threat to
Mega-Tanks are indirect attacks and some air units, but not Battle Helicopters
(unless it has Zadia at the helm). This unit fares well against choppers, and
providing it gets a first strike, it also goes well versus Anti-Tank units.
Overall, it should be saved for area defense, and late pushes for victory.

Takedown
--------
A one-hit takedown requires an Ace/Vet Bomber and a lot of luck. Mega Tanks
have lots of trouble with Rockets, being incapable of playing a game of
range-dodging with them (because they can't move through for the KO in one turn
like Heavy Tanks). Exploit this and slam some Rockets into a chokepoint
alongside some heavy-duty 'persuaders' and watch them run. Battle Heli's won't
work anymore, though. Anti-Tanks were designed to knock these fiends down, but
don't leave them on roads EVER. A Mega Tank can do surprisingly good damage to
Anti-Tanks, especially when boosted.

Whatever you do, don't let the enemy Ace/Vet a Mega Tank. This can prove
difficult, however, as Mega Tanks tend to gun for your much more vulnerable
units (Infantry, Recons) first rather than aim for a 'decent' attack, to
quickly boost its abilities.

CPR
---
The biggest fault of the CO Mega Tank is the 24K price tag. For that, though,
you get an extremely powerful force that's also quite stubborn to knock out. If
the attack boost reaches 150%, then you can knock out Bazooka units in one hit,
even if they are in the mountains. Be aware that for an additional 1000 you
could get the decisive Battleship (if there's a navy you can use, mind).

My Two Cents
------------
Infinitely better than before, especially in Fog of War. A vision zone of 3
means that the only way it cannot see where it is shooting is during a
Trak-Catleia CO Power! Being an indirect unit it is incapable of self-defense,
so guard it with any and all units at your disposal. Even 1HP Infantry have
their uses, you know.

Provided it is protected well, this unit can be decisive in taking an enemy
Factory by softening up anything the enemy builds from it. The only weakness
of this unit is the Rocket unit, which outclasses it in virtually every way
(except mobility, Tire A movement is annoying).

Takedown
--------
Mech Gun units are easy to knock out, but because the enemy will protect them
with units and useful terrain, it can prove problematic especially in low-fund
maps. Chokepoint effectiveness becomes minimal in maps with airports so
sneaking a Battle Heli. in for a pot-shot can buy you enough time to push
onwards. Aside from this, out-range them with superior Rockets and Battleships.

CPR
---
I've not practiced with this type of CO Post, but I hear it's quite the beast.
Having the defending units in the CO Zone is enormously useful (as long as you

In a sentence, the Anti-Tank is probably the single most unbalanced unit in AW
history. Taking one down cost-effectively requires the strategic know-how of a
crack team of WW2 generals. To make matters worse, it pulverises ground
vehicles and helicopters and withstands attacks like a solid block of Titanium,
AND it can counterattack! What is wrong with this unit, and how can it be
stopped?!?

Well, let me calm down for one. The main method for disposing of these pesky
units is to out-range them using Rockets and Battleships. At the very least,
you can force it away from that vital piece of land it is trying to cover.
Secondly, despite its awesome offensive prowess, its shells do what is known
as piercing damage. It therefore has a few problems with Infantry (however, it
will still hurt). Thirdly, with a mobility rating of four and Tire B movement,
it is hopleless at reaching its destination in good time. Most importantly,
however, Infantry deal good damage against Anti-Tanks. They may not take them
down in 2 hits, but they deal damage comparable to what a Tank would cause.

Takedown
--------
I've already mentioned this, but here's a recap. Anti-Tanks will eventually
fall, but you need to hit it a lot before you can even cripple it. If you used
vehicles against it, ensure that the counterattack damage doesn't exceed the
cost of the Anti-Tank (ie 11000). Like the Mech Gun though, the best method is
to out-range it with Rockets and Battleships. Battle Heli's won't work though,
you're limited to Ship Planes and Bombers to KO it by air. Also remember to
throw Infantry-type units at it, particularly Motorbikes.

Extremely slow, rather costly, and also quite awesome, is the CO A-T unit.
You'll once again have your meatshielding units in the CO Zone for additional
longevity. You'll see Trak in this unit a lot.

My Two Cents
------------
Comparing the Mech Gun to the Rocket unit is akin to comparing the scale model
of the Enterprise to the real deal (not that it exists *ahem*). Everything is
bigger with the exception of mobility. The actual mobility is unchanged, but
Tire A type units lose colossal amounts of agility over any tiles with no
roads/cities.

The attack power goes up by about +2HP damage, the range goes up from 3 to 5,
the blindspot goes up by 1. And the usefulness? Unmeasurable. A well-placed
Rocket unit is the best unit in the game. Just protect it well, it has little
tolerance to enemy attack.

Takedown
--------
Out-ranging a Rocket unit is only possible with the Battleship, so you will
have to use your head to take one down. The best counter to a Rocket is to
prevent it from reaching that crucial choke in the first place. If it heads
your way, go out of your way to hit it hard. If it does make its nest, your
only chance is to rush it with a massive armada of heavy armour, or to throw
air units at it. The Battle Heli can pay for itself in terms of the damage it
can do to even a well-shielded Rocket unit.

CPR
---
Not too useful actually. For one, it's damn expensive, damn slow, and the large
blind-spot means that you need a CO Zone radius of at least 2 to defend it
effectively. Really useful attack boosts at hand though.

Due to the redesigned Carrier, the Missile unit remains the sole (yet original)
ranged aerial counter. From previous games, the range has increased to 6. Which
is peculiar because Rockets have a range of 5, you would expect similar
payloads to travel the same distance, surely?

Anyways, this unit makes anything airborne cower. Choppers? Blown away.
Fighters? Shot down. Bombers? Pulverised. Providing the unit isn't at Ace/Vet
level or is lying in a CO zone, it'll get wiped out in a single attack. You can
completely ruin an enemy airport by parking one of these nearby. The enemy
isn't likely to build anything if it is instantly knocked out of the sky before
it can even move! Watch out: somehow, in Fog Of War, Airports actually act as
aerial unit hiding places! Usual indirect rules apply though: guard them well.

Takedown
--------
Because it only hits air units, feel free to go in with the Tanks to hit it
unless it has some serious backup. Despite the fact that it counters aircraft,
Battle Heli's can camp just outside their range and go in for a power hit the
next turn.

We all know this as the APC from previous games. Compared to previous
generations it would seem that nothing has changed. Oh, but it has! It can now
create Temporary Airports on Plains and Temporary Ports on beaches! Easily
worth the asking price all on its own! But just how useful are these
structures?

They generate no funds, so don't think of it as a cheap way of boosting money.
They can't build anything, just service existing units. Their defensive cover
is nothing compared to their true counterparts.

However, they can reduce move cost for those annoying Tire A units. T-Ports
allow ships to move deeper inland than usual, while keeping enemy ships (not
landers) out. Be creative with where you put them and you can create a safe
naval haven from enemy Submarines (Channel City comes to mind)!

Most importantly, and most overlooked, they create hiding places for Fog of
War! In some maps, placing one in a hiding-place-free chokepoint can make the
enemys lives just a bit more annoying to bear. Another thing is that because
the temporary structure is a property, it generates a field of vision in Fog of
War like the other bases.

My Two Cents

Ah, yes, the Battleship. Before it was an immobile super-Rocket unit. Now its
been changed rather massively. Everybody talks about how its better than ever,
but its also been nerfed and some people just don't see how, they just say
'10 range FTW' or equivalent.

Speaking of range, this is the sole indirect blessed with the ability to move
and fire on the same turn. So, combine 5 mobility with a 3-5 range and you do
indeed get the kind of attack range Nostradamus didn't see coming.

Hold it though, don't get carried away. In comparision to before, its attack
power seems to have fallen off the radar since AWDS. Not that it's low, its
just unspectacular. In small seas, it can be difficult for the enhanced range
to be utilised effectively. Also, be careful attacking units at the far reaches
of the Battleships attack range, you may end up sailing into the line of fire
if you are careless!

Takedown
--------
This can prove tricky. Battleships are rarely seen without Cruiser escort. If
you are lucky and the Cruiser is nowhere to be seen, feel free to hit it with
air units and Submarines. If the Cruiser is in the area, this can be a fatal
error. Your best bet is to prioritise taking the Cruiser with a Battleship of
your own. Failing that, send 3-4 Missile Boats across and swarm the Battleship,
or try to lure it into a trap.

CPR
---
In. Cred. Ible. A CO Battleship gets the firepower it had in the previous
games. Charging the CO meter in one of these is no problem at all. Just be
careful. At 37500 it's extremely costly, and it also becomes a priority target
for the enemy.

My Two Cents
------------
The Carrier is completely different from the one in AWDS. Previously it was a
naval Missile unit which happened to be able to haul aircraft around. Now it
revolves completely around what actual Aircraft Carriers are supposed to do; be
a naval base for an air force. Offensively, the Carrier has virtually nothing
going for it on its own. It has an AA gun, but it does very low damage, and
should be used only as a finishing attack or when there is no risk of a
counterattack. Defensively, it is very fragile and is constantly in fear of
being sunk in one hit by enemy Submarines.

The main reason for building Carriers is the ability to manufacture up to four
Ship Planes. These are covered later on, but to summarise, for an additional
15000 credit, you gain a short range attack plane that can attack almost
anything and score high amounts of damage. Even if you run out of materials for
the Carrier, it can service any other aircraft such as Bombers and choppers,
AND repair them as well! Deadly, but don't prioritise building one until your
navy is set up first.

Takedown
--------
Submarines can sink Carriers in one blast. Trying to take it down using other
methods is dependant on if the Carrier has any Ship Planes. If not, flatten it.
If it does, be extremely cautious: Ship Planes OHKO Missile Boats, cause pain
to Battleships and even Cruisers can be Double-Teamed. Still, use Submarines.
Anything else is a Plan-B.

My Two Cents
------------
Other than the Battleship and maybe the Missile Boat, this is the primary
anti-ship weapon for any navy. A MAJOR boost for the Submarine is that it is
already submerged when built, meaning you can sneak them out of the port
without the enemy being capable of killing it before it can even move! You get
the option to rise and dive the Sub when moved. On the surface, it acts like a
Missile Boat and is very much a priority target for the enemy (get it now or
play hide and seek later), and underwater, the fuel burn rate goes up 500% but
it is virtually impossible to see or hit! To even see one, you need to move a
unit directly next to the Sub.

Offensively, it remains rather unchanged. However, it has more trouble against
Landers; you'll need at least an Ace/Vet boost for any chance of taking them
out in one attack. It is still preyed upon by Cruisers, so stay well away! If
there is one nearby and you can attack a key target, only do so if you have
another unit to hit the Cruiser and/or you KO the target: If the target
survives the hit, the Sub may as well have a 'Kick Me' sign sticking out of the
water 'cos it's an easy KO for the Cruiser.

Takedown
--------
Cruisers. I don't need to say much else other than trying to reveal hidden Subs
can be a mission in itself. Subs can only wipe out Missile Boats and Carriers
in one hit. If it hits anything else, it will likely be a sitting duck as the
wounded vessel marks the Sub with a bullseye. If you are actively searching for
a Sub, have 1-2 Missile Boats escort the Cruiser. Have them move randomly
around the ocean and hope they crash or park alongside the Sub. And if the Sub
takes out one of the Missile Boats, move the other one onto the other's grave
and get'em!

CPR
---
Interesting to say the least. 30K nets you enough attack power to kill Landers
in one hit now. This doesn't mean that it is brilliant however. Even when
submerged, a skilled human opponent can locate a CO Submarine by attacking
nearby naval units. If it takes unusually low levels of damage, the CO post is
nearby.

Previous title holder of 'Most Stubborn unit to kill' and still going strong.
Cruisers have way too much good stuff considering its relative inexpensiveness.
5 vision, 6 mobility, KOs aerial units and Subs in one hit, annoys everything
else, what is wrong with this unit?

And the answer is: nothing. It cannot enter the ground battle, but the Cruiser
is still a ridiculously over-useful naval assault force. It now does more
damage to any naval unit (except other Cruisers) since the last outing.
Although they can be taken out, it is impossible to KO in one attack unless
the attacker has some serious boosts.

Oh, and did I mention it can transport 2 choppers in complete safety?

Takedown
--------
The only time a Cruiser can be KO'd in one hit is with a highly boosted
Battleship. Even without the boost, Battleships are the primary counter to
enemy Cruisers. Cruisers can also be pinned down by Missile Boats; bring 2-3
along for a good old game of range-dodging.

Nothing has changed for this unit, except maybe the price and a slight up in

ground units and drop them off on ports and beaches. Very little to say since
it is defenseless. Just watch out for Submarines.

Takedown
--------
The best way to tackle these things is to block off any area of land where the
enemy Lander is likely to dump its cargo, using anything you have. There isn't
much point in using landing craft if there is nowhere to land in the first
place! Actively taking them down in one hit requires a Bomber or a boosted
Submarine/Battleship/Ship-Plane. Cruisers and Missile Boats dent them well too.
When they land, Tanks and ranged attacks can weaken the Lander slowly but
surely.

A new addition to the naval frontier, and it has a bit of an identity crisis.
The EU call it a Missile Boat but the Americans call it a Gunboat. In reality,
it's a Missile Boat (look it up on Wikipedia if you don't believe me).

Akin to Landers, they can carry ONE Infantry/Mech unit and transport them
faster with their 7 mobility. Defensively, they are among the most fragile
units around (even Tanks KO them in 2 hits). Offensively, they have only one
shot of their Anti-Ship gun before a resupply is needed. The actual attack does
approximately 4HP damage to ships and 6HP damage to transporters. That may not
seem much, but get a lucky shot on a Carrier and the 6000 credit Missile Boat
has paid for itself twice!

On their own, however, they can only play range-dodging with enemy Cruisers.
Have them travel in pairs (or even wolfpacks if you like overkill) and
experiment with luring Battleships, blocking and smashing supply lines and
causing general havoc. Just ensure they have no Submarines, and have fun!

Takedown
--------
They are ridiculously fragile. They are felled in one hit by ranged attacks,
Subs, Bombers and Ship Planes. If you can hit it, you can at least get a 2HKO.
The problem is that good players have them travel in packs, making KO via
Battleship/Cruiser a poor option.

CPR

Fun to say the least. Fastest naval unit allows for maximum zone spreading
across large oceans. You are still really vulnerable to attack, and the attack
power boost has more trouble paying for itself now the price jumps to 9000.

If you see a squadron of air units approaching, you can pump out the Anti-Air
units. If you force them to retreat, gun them down with these! Interceptors
have unrivalled mobility in the skies! They can one-shot enemy choppers,
cripple Bombers, flatten Fighters and cause general mayhem in the air war.
They also have high vision, so they can be used as scouts in Fog of War
(although at 20000 a piece, it's not too wise to venture TOO far into the enemy
domain).

Their attack power does seem to have faltered a bit since AWDS. Either that or
the Bomber makers have gotten wise and fitted heavier armor, because Bombers
can no longer be KOd in one hit by enemy Interceptors. Mind you, it will still
hurt a lot.

Takedown
--------
The most resiliant of air units alongside the Bomber. All air units can be
swept away with Missiles and Cruisers. Outside of this rule of thumb, the
strategies vary a lot. The Interceptor was designed for Aerial combat, so avoid
this method unless you have no other option. Other Interceptor units deal about
6HP damage, Fighters about 4HP. So use Aerials as a finisher. Other than that,
use AAs to soften them up a bit.

Another annoying thing you can do to air units (particularly Interceptors) is
to surround them with nearby units. If the enemy was playing sneaky around the
area covered by your countermeasures, you can hold the target in place long
enough to get the AA in for a KO.

CPR
---
Whoa. Guaranteed one-hit KOs on anything excluding other Interceptors and maybe
Bombers. A very intimidating sight, but it's costly and a little restrictive on
what it can hit. Best unit for moving that CO Zone about.

primary weapon against those decisive units such as Battleships and Anti-Tanks.
Unless the enemy has some serious defenses the Bomber can send just about
anything into a world of pain.

Just be aware that this thing is helpless against Interceptors and even
Fighters. Keep an eye out for Cruisers and AA units that travel in pairs. It
may seem like an easy power-hit, but the next turn will make mincemeat out of
20000 credit of flying death.

Takedown
--------
Cruisers and Missiles work. Ensure the Bomber doesn't hit the Missiles first
though. Interceptors and Fighters can outrun Bombers and make them run for
cover. AA units will work, but the Bomber will not likely fall in one hit
unless it's been weakened slightly (usually from hitting another AA). Use
multiple AAs to deter them.

CPR
---
AA units everywhere will have sleepless nights over these. Even a Lili CO
Bomber can knock them out in one hit on (and up to) 1-star terrain. Any more
boosts and it gets simply beyond overkill and more like genocide.

My Two Cents
------------
Call it an 'Entry-Level Interceptor' if you will. This unit also has
conflicting names. Europeans get Fighter (the name for the Interceptor in
previous games) where the Americans get the name 'Duster' (probably related to
in-game stories about the unit being a converted cropduster). They actually
resemble good old WW2 fighter planes, and that can only be a good thing, right?

Well, sort of. Being propellor driven means it cannot outrun Interceptors
(however 8 mobility isn't exactly slow). And having Machine Guns means that the
damage it deals isn't too spectacular either. It will need to be at Ace/Vet
level to KO choppers in one hit. It can also attack ground units, but only
expect decent damage versus Infantry.

Where this unit truly shines is in the hands of a specialist CO, where it
becomes an aerial powerhouse for slightly less money than the Interceptor.

Takedown
--------
Aside from the usual two, Interceptors have a chance for a takedown if it is at
Ace/Vet level. AAs also work the same. If Fighters aren't hitting every chopper
you have, they will most likely be taking pot-shots at your capturing Infantry,
so escort them with an AA to give them an afterthought or such.

CPR
---
The second half of the AWDC fanbases CO unit pairing. Very fast, guaranteed
takedowns on choppers, can hold their ground against Interceptors even. Still
can't hit armor for much though.

AI Posts

The same as for the Interceptor, namely loads of them. You'll be seeing these a
lot in any aerial battle.

My Two Cents
------------
Previously, the Battle Helicopter was a unit that took what I refer to as
binary levels of damage: it would take no damage, or get swatted down like the
swarm of annoying flies that they are. Forget flies, actually, they are more
like wasps. Now, they seem to be much more vulnerable to damage from Machine
Guns than before, resulting in a slightly lower effectiveness on the
battlefield. What's more, the introduction of cheap Fighters and AA units make
it even harder to use than before.

Don't get put off though, because they can prove decisive. Their relative cheap
cost means that in a deadlock, you can send them across the front lines on
suicide missions. Nail a few key units and you can gain an opportunity to push
though and cause a lot of damage. Considering their low cost, they work well up
to Heavy Tanks, but Mega Tanks can gain the upper hand if they hit first. All
in all, still useful, but more vulnerable.

Takedown
--------
Lots of stuff can hit choppers. Any aerial countermeasure (minus Fighters)
smash through these in one hit. Fighters cripple them, Mega Tanks dent them a
bit. Be aware that the enemy may use these to annoy your key units. Use
Missiles to cover likely attack spots the chopper may use. But be careful using
Missiles as Battle Heli's can range-dodge these units and win.

CPR
---
Potentially scary, but with cheaper AA units and low-cost Fighters, using one
is no easy feat to achieve, to say the least. A Zadia Battle Heli. sweeps
Infantry away and are capable of threatening even enemy Mega Tanks.

Positives
---------
Can transport Infantry across all terrain quickly.

Negatives
---------
Defenseless.

Attacks Used
------------
Incapable of attack.

My Two Cents
------------
These haven't changed at all. Use them to transport Infantry/Mech units across
mountains and seas to capture distance properties. They possess the armor of a
sheath of silk and are liable to being shot down in one hit by nearly every
aerial countermeasure. Be vigilant.

Takedown
--------
LOADS OF STUFF. The same as the Battle Heli, but the Trans. Heli. is vulnerable
to just about any unit that can attack it. Even Infantry stand a chance of a
3HKO on one, so don't venture into an area even if it doesn't have any AAs.

06) Ship Plane (US Name: Seaplane)

An All New Unit.

Currently...
------------
Cost: 15000 (From Carriers)
Range: 7
Vision: 3
Type: Air
Fuel: 40
Primary Weapon: Missiles (3)
Secondary Weapon: None.

E-3-2-1
-------
E - All Units
3 - Carrier, Fighter
2 - Anti-Air, Interceptor, Ship Plane

Positives
---------
They can attack any unit for solid damage.
Relatively inexpensive.

Negatives
---------
Extremely low fuel count.
Can only be deployed from an expensive Carrier.
Not particularly capable of causing collateral damage to units.
Slowest plane.

Attacks Used
------------

Target|P-W|S-W
======+===+===
Inftry| Y |---
Ground| Y |---
Aerial| Y |---
Heli's| Y |---
Ships | Y |---
Subs  | Y |---

My Two Cents
------------
The ace in the Carrier's hand. The Ship Plane is cheap, but to build one you
need 28000 to get a Carrier. It takes three days and 43000 credit overall to
let loose with even one Ship Plane. So, what is the point, really? This unit
can attack anything and everything (well, exclude hidden Subs from the
equation) and score solid damage (~6HP on average). Absolute genius.

However, look at the fuel gauge and it really does say 40. This unit has
extremely low range. Go 10 spaces from the Carrier and you risk it falling out
of the sky. Also, it isn't exactly fast (well, for a plane).

Takedown
--------
Ship Planes have notoriously low supply levels. If you can't knock it out and
it is inland, surround it with units and wait for it to run out of fuel. Be
careful, because the enemy will not let that happen and it is likely that they
will send in a rescue force. Release it just as it is about to crash and burn
so you can get back to helping the war effort.

CPR
---
This would have been a good CO Post if it didn't have a fuel tank the size of a
light bulb. As an attack force, then, a CO Ship Plane is extremely capable, but
a little too short on range (unless you have Sigismundo in the cockpit and is
trying to chain CO Powers. It's possible!).
